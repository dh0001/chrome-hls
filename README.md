# HLS and DASH Playback

HLS and DASH playback in browsers

This extension redirects m3u8 and mpd files to extension pages embedding [hls.js][] and [dash.js][], and attempts to play the files using those libraries.

The menu opened from the icon has two capabilities:

  * Redirect behavior can be toggled, allowing m3u8 and mpd files to be downloaded normally.
  * Zoom can be toggled, changing if the video should be resized to fit the screen.

[dash.js]: https://github.com/Dash-Industry-Forum/dash.js
